# ðŸ§® Sum of Digits

This is a simple Java program that calculates the **sum of all digits** of a given integer. It uses a `while` loop to extract digits from the number and accumulate their total.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

* Calculates the sum of digits of a hardcoded integer (`12345`).
* Demonstrates the use of loops and arithmetic operations.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Prerequisites

* Java installed (JDK 8 or higher)

### Steps

1. Save the code in a file named `SumOfDigits.java`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program:

   ```bash
   javac SumOfDigits.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   java SumOfDigits
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Sample Output

```
15
```

(*Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15*)

## ðŸ”„ Optional Enhancement

You can modify the program to take user input instead of using a hardcoded number.
